Discussing how people improve as software engineers is something I really enjoy studying, thinking and reading about.

I have written in the past about:

- [How to improve as a developer, even when it's hard](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-better-at-programming-even-when-its-hard/)
- [My 4 best tips to improve as a developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-become-a-better-developer/)

I love thinking/reading about questions like:

- How do people progress professionally as engineers?
- How do developers go [from Senior to Staff](https://staffeng.com/) or beyond?
- How do Engineer scale themselves? 

Part of the answer I think, is looking at the Compotency Matrices and Career Progression ladders companies put out to explain what they expect in each role.

Trying to look and standardise what each totally different companies search for - helps you understand what is valuable in the marketplace.

This has led me to compiling around 70 publicly accessible career matrices from companies around the world.

You can read them all [here](https://github.com/kealanparr/Career-progression-matrices/edit/main/README.md)

I've been spending time looking at "where I fit" and thinking about ways I can improve.

I hope this is of use to you too!
