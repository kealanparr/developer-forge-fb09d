Hofstadter’s law is best explained [as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law):

*It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law*

In software application, it normally means software estimates are always too small, *even* when you keep in mind Hofstadter’s law and add some extra time to the estimate!

There is a huge amount of software practices/thinking to try and get estimates to be much closer, one of the main ones being to estimate work in **effort** not **time**.

To know exactly how long something will take is very difficult, and is more often than not a guess or guideline and nothing more.

But to estimate in **effort** is often used as you can break it down more discretely into (for example): easy work, medium difficult or hard work.
