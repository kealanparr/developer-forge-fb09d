Engineers are constantly learning new things.

New software patterns, paradigms, ways of working, code structure, languages, libraries, frameworks *etc*

Good engineers I know are constantly trying to maximise their learning to make themselves even better at what they do.

I have had to do this too & continually read, write and develop to become a better coder.

So as I learn new things, I will endevaour to add the useful resources to the list.

This is just what helped me, if there are better resources, contact me via this site - and let me know!
