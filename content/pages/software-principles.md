Roadmap and rough estimates.

The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router) - https://auden.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/learn/lecture/14375650#notes

>>>>> You are either going to smash this or lose your job. Chose now how you'll spend your time. <<<<

=== Week 1: 14th - 21st April
Waiting for Auden first meeting ‚úÖ
=== Week 2: 21st - 28th April
Jamstack general overview - Build time generate all markup, push to CDN. Filter out to users. Blazing fast. ‚úÖ
ns3 - Network simulation model. Think you got the wrong acronym. ‚úÖ
class presentation? Not even sure how this links ‚úÖ

How to learn Docker:
Firstly watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqqDU2crIEQ  ‚úÖ

and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7ABlHngi1Q  ‚úÖ

Very cool Docker playground:
https://labs.play-with-docker.com/p/c22mhvvqf8u000b72s3g  ‚úÖ

Look at Docker anatomy file
https://gist.github.com/adamveld12/4815792fadf119ef41bd  ‚úÖ

and have a look at Dockerhub for things you can download
https://hub.docker.com/  ‚úÖ

Then download docker and get the below running on your local, either command line or with Docker desktop:
- For me getting it to run was a bit of a pain
- Had to boot PC bios and enable virtualisation
- Also Origin kept running on port 80 so I had to either stop it or launch my images on unused port
https://github.com/dockersamples/101-tutorial  ‚úÖ

Now build an image for a really simple basic nodejs app

Once you have done that watch:
Containers talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc  ‚úÖ

And then read:
https://medium.com/@saschagrunert/demystifying-containers-part-i-kernel-space-2c53d6979504  ‚úÖ

And then work through stuff on github
http://localhost:45/tutorial/  ‚úÖ
http://localhost:45/tutorial/what-next/  ‚úÖ

How to learn React:

Beginner:
https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

Go through FCC React work:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#react

Start by reading through:
https://scotch.io/starters/react/getting-started-with-react-2019-edition?ref=home-start-here

If you want to dive straight into coding:
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app
Then do the FCC front-end projects
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#front-end-libraries-projects

Go through this instead of Jakes shit:
https://egghead.io/q/react

then do react project on fcc

How to learn go:

- Include in here making a golang blog post platform

https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-with-go-for-frontend-developers/

And also covers how to debug go
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-go

Interesting perspective
https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/commandments

Error handling
https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover

The above teaches so much valuable stuff like for example
https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module
Go create modules

How to learn go:
Complete a tour of go

Read to write good code
https://golang.org/doc/effective_go

https://golang.org/doc/

Read through the go standard package:
https://golang.org/pkg/

Then read through a golang code base, like:
https://github.com/kealanparr/compose-cli

This is also really good
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-go


For something interactive for you to configure and play around with and hack asnd break and rehack- try this
https://github.com/heroku/go-getting-started


Get hands on quicker rather than lots of reading
https://github.com/miekg/learninggo

Read
https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module

Then follow along and make
https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/

make a go rest endpoint solo

make golang connect to db solo

Read
https://golang.org/doc/code

Then read through a golang code base, like:
https://github.com/kealanparr/compose-cli

Have a little read through the concurrency stuff:
https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1

Go through the Tutorial section on the site, loads to do!
https://golang.org/doc/

The above task should have forced you to go through gomodules task below:
go modules
https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules
https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module
https://golang.org/doc/effective_go
https://golang.org/pkg/

Work through concurrency on go tour

go modules
https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules
https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module
https://golang.org/doc/effective_go
https://golang.org/pkg/

make golang connect to db solo - final serious golang thing
make dockerfile too
C:\dev\go-blog

Then read through a golang code base, like:
https://github.com/kealanparr/compose-cli

Have a little read through the concurrency stuff:
https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1

Read
https://golang.org/doc/code
https://golang.org/doc/effective_go
