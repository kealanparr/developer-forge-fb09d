I firstly started by reading [this article](https://scotch.io/starters/react/getting-started-with-react-2019-edition)

I then read React documentation. React (as of 2022) are re-working their docs, so the beta docs are [here](https://beta.reactjs.org/), or the "current" docs (not in beta) are [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

I then worked through the [freeCodeCamp exerises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#react)

From here, I just coded up basic React apps using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app)

So I made a web-app to test solutions to [Einsteins riddle](https://einsteins-riddle.com/)

Or if you need project ideas, you can [look here for inspiration](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#front-end-libraries-projects)

If starting to code projects feels too hard, try a [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) first

And I also really enjoyed the [courses on egghead](https://egghead.io/q/react)

I have done my best to keep paid courses away from all "How to Learn" posts, but honourable mention to [Colt Steeles course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) which is very valuable. But don't pay more than $25 or so. Udemy is known to have HUGE price fluctuations.
