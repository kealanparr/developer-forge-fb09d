Start with a [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1), and solve all the challenges

Then just begin reading [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

The above steps were inspired by [Jeff Hodges](https://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/12/26/code-to-read-when-learning-go/)

I found this [overview](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-go) very useful

I also spent some time reading through the [docs](https://go.dev/doc/) 

At this point, I'd recommend just building and breaking things, specifically:

- Experimenting, breaking and deploying: https://github.com/heroku/go-getting-started
- Make an endpoint to recieve a string, and return the sum of all the characters unicode code-points
- Make a go connect to a containerised database

If the above sounds too intimidating, you can code along your first app [here](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/)

I found it very useful to just read lots and lots of good go code, example code can be found at [compose-cli](https://github.com/docker/compose-cli) or [cli](https://github.com/docker/cli) or just the go [standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/std)

I also found it useful to read [How to Write Go Code](https://go.dev/doc/code)

And I also have heard lots of good things about [learninggo](https://miek.nl/go/)
