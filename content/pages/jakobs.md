*Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know*

Users are more familiar with how everyone is making websites.

Small, assumptions are always present when they use your website.

- A left facing arrow will take them back in their navigation history
- To read more content, it's generally done by scrolling down (not up *e.g.*)
- Underlined words are often hyper links and are clickable
- Green is often associated with upvotes/likes and red is downvotes/dislikes - not the other way around

By following the flow you see and expect on other websites - on the websites you create, you will make users of your site much happier and ensure using it is intuitive.
