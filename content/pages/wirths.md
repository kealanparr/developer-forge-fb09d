Wirth's Law is the idea that software [is getting slower faster than hardware is getting faster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law).

Martin Reiser was the first to say something similar, where he [said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law) in the preface of a book "The hope is that the progress in hardware will cure all software ills. However, a critical observer may observe that software manages to outgrow hardware in size and sluggishness."
